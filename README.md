# McLean-Ratfish

## Exercise 1

Are there any patterns in abundance across latitudes and longitudes?

## Research question

I'm thinking it would be helpful to display this as a histogram with bins of latitudes/longititudes every X units. Ratfish biomass will be on the y- axis. I'm not sure how exactly to do that with, or if it is possible
